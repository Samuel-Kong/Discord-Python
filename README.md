# Discord-Python
Discord bot made with Discord.py

This is my first bot in Discord.py, usually I use Disnake

I learnt how to use Discord.py and realised it's not so different from Disnake

I got confused in same parts when I wasn't sure what was the Discord.py equal of what I used in Disnake but a quick documentation search helped me resolve issues quickly

This wasn't very difficult
